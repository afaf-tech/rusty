/* Interior mutability is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data; 
normally, this action is disallowed by the borrowing rules. */

/* Here is a recap of the reasons to choose Box<T>, Rc<T>, or RefCell<T>:

- Rc<T> enables multiple owners of the same data; Box<T> and RefCell<T> have single owners.
- Box<T> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; Rc<T> allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; 
    RefCell<T> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
- Because RefCell<T> allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, 
    you can mutate the value inside the RefCell<T> even when the RefCell<T> is immutable. */
